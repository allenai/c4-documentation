# C4 Documetation



This website is a link for  for documenting the contents of the Colossal
Clean Crawled Corpus (C4), used to train the [T5 pre-trained language
model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683).

We provide some documentation for the contents of C4 in our paper, [Documenting the English Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jessed/data_hosting/documenting_c4.pdf).

## Accessing C4

*Raw data download:* If you want to download C4 to run your own analysis on it, we have made the raw
C4 data available to download [here](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5056).

*Search index:* To search through the data using our search engine, we made [https://c4-search.apps.allenai.org/](https://c4-search.apps.allenai.org/). Check it out!

## Documenting issues

Our paper documents many interesting and/or problematic issues with the C4 dataset, but it is in no
way an exhaustive exploration of the data.  We hope the [discussions
page](https://github.com/allenai/c4-documentation/discussions) on this github repository will be a
welcome place to document and discuss further issues with the data.  If you find something
interesting that you want to share, please [start a new
discussion](https://github.com/allenai/c4-documentation/discussions/new) and let everyone know what
you found.
