# C4 Documetation

This website is a link for  for documenting the contents of the Colossal
Clean Crawled Corpus (C4), used to train the [T5 pre-trained language
model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683). 


## Accessing C4

*Raw data download:* If you want to download C4 to run your own analysis on it, we have made the raw
C4 data available to download [here (LINK TODO)](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5056).

*Search index:* If you just want to browse through the data using a search engine, we have made a
simple website to do so [here (LINK TODO)](#TODO).

## Running our analysis

Scripts to reproduce or extend the analyses in our paper can be found in this repository.  These
scripts must be run over the raw data.

## Documenting issues

Our paper documents many interesting and/or problematic issues with the C4 dataset, but it is in no
way an exhaustive exploration of the data.  We hope the [discussions
page](https://github.com/allenai/c4-documentation/discussions) on this github repository will be a
welcome place to document and discuss further issues with the data.  If you find something
interesting that you want to share, please [start a new
discussion](https://github.com/allenai/c4-documentation/discussions/new) and let everyone know what
you found.
